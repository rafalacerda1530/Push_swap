# Push_swap
A sorting algorithm with specific movements



A sorting algorithm with specific moves

push swap performs the ordering from lowest to highest according to the moves below and between two stacks, "a & b"

instruction
description<b>
sa<b>
Swap A - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A.<br>
sb<br>
Swap B - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B.<br>
pa<br>
Push A - take the first element at the top of B and put it at the top of A.<br>
pb<br>
Push B - take the first element at the top of A and put it at the top of B.<br>
ra<br>
Rotate A - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.<br>
rb<br>
Rotate B - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.<br>
rra<br>
Reverse rotate A - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.<br>
rrb<br>
Reverse rotate B - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.+<br>


he performs around 800 moves with 100 numbers and around 8500 with 500 numbers<br>

to run just do:<br>
-make<br>
./push <random numbers><br>
just replace "random numbers" with the amount of numbers you want,
